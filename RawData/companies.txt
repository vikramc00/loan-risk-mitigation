Notes:

* There are two semi-overlapping transaction files for this borrower.
This is a fairly common occurrence in our data due to merging
multiple data sources.  We try to merge them into a single data
set, but in some cases (like this one), have not yet completed
reconciling the data.

* We made three loans to this business.  The first was for $500k
in Oct 2017.  It was recapped to $630k in Oct 2018, and then to
$810k in Apr 2019.

* This borrower struggled to make payments on the third loan in a
timely manner, but ultimately paid the entire amount off in Sep
2021, seven months before the maturity date of 4/30/2022.
